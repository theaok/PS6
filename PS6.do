*Problem Set 6 due
*Stata Version 15/IC 


/* For Problem Set 6 I began to work on my final project by organizing and simpliying my exisiting work. 
I also began to see a clearer picture about the impact of environment (food access, poverty) on health in NJ emerge through descriptive statistics. 
______________________________________________________________________

Research questions include the following: 
1- Does inaccces to healthy food impact behavior and mental health?
2- Does increased green space decrease poverty and mental health ?
3- Who is most impacted by pollution (by race, gender, income)? 
4- Do counties with higher pollution experience worse health outcomes (physical and mental)? 
______________________________________________________________________

My completed dataset includes data from the following sources: 
1- NJ County Health Rankings Data (http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/rankings/data/nj)
2- New Jersey Behavioral Risk Factor Survey, Center for Health Statistics, New Jersey Department of Health Statistics, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD) (http://nj.gov/health/shad) 
3- U.S. Census Bureau, 2016 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates
4- Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. Acute Toxic Substance Releases (www.cdc.gov/ephtracking) note: I would love to have data from 2015 since most of my other datasets are from this year but this was the most recent I could find. This would be good to research further. 
5- EPA Outdoor Air Quality Report (https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/air-quality-statistics-report)
6- Food Access and Research Center (FARC) and it is County SNAP (food stamp) usage from 2011-2015 and simply shows the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
7- U.S. Census Bureau population counts by County for 2010-2016 (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk) 

Note: Regions are defined as North, Central and South as defined by the State of New Jersey http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/about/directory/images/regionmapc150.gif

				  Prelimiarly discussion of findings 
								   
								   
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>*/

/*At this stage in my research I can see that my data confirms popular research 
about food access and health. While food access is just one of the compounding 
variables that impact a person's health (physical and mental) this is important
to look into more closely. Initial regressions show that access to food does not
mean the same for people in poverty as opposed to the general population. For
those on foodstamps, food access only improves their health at half the rate. 
And those who utilize food stamps have increased instances of physically 
and mentally unhealthy days per month as well as lower birth weights, and higher 
rates of obesity. 
 
When looking at New Jersey at the county level it is clear that South Jersey 
(while smaller in population) does face a substantial burden in terms of social 
ills. Stress levels are high, food insecurity, child poverty,obesity, loss of 
life are all increased for counties such as Cumberland, Salem, Ocean and Atlantic.
Important to note, the data shows that food inaccess can lead to decreased life 
expectancy, low birth rates, and lower rates of health. 

Therefore it is important to think about what is currently being done to 
address issues of hunger and health and to further analyze the usefulness of 
the food stamp program since even increases in access to healthy food and the
vouchers for food are not leading to increased health outcomes. 
There are many social programs in place such as farmers markets that accept 
food stamps, cooking classes and health eating programming, but the question 
remains- are they working and what else can be done to counter these negative 
health outcomes?

I will continue to look into how this data intersects with race and if time 
permits- pollution. In the future I will also try to incorporate SNAP data in 
regards to programming/education and attitudes towards food.*/
